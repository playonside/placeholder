        <p>Build a team driven by a mission. Build a team striving for something greater than themselves, united by a common culture.</p>

        <p>Recruiting is about more than talent. It's about values.</p>

        <p>Recruiting is about finding people who will fight for your mission, values, and team, and adopting them into your family.</p>

        <p>We're building a tool to help intentionally recruit the right people, not just great players.</p>
